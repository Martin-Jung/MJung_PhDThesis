% SI - Figure 1 Missing data
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{chapter3/SI01}
\caption{ Average temporal distribution of Landsat data and an example times series of Landsat data. (\textbf{a}) Distribution of available Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data in years covered by the Landsat missions. Points show the average monthly EVI data availability per year (0 to 12 months of data) across time series and PREDICTS sites grouped by 15\textdegree latitude bins. The size of points indicates the mean data availability (0 to 100\% with 100\% having 12 months of available data in a given year), while the colour shows the number of PREDICTS sites contributing to the mean (as PREDICTS sites were sampled in varying years). (\textbf{b}) Example time series for one PREDICTS site with a high proportion of missing data before 1999. In all analyses such time series were truncated to the period from 1999 onwards (indicated by the dashed line).}

% SI - Figure 2 Binning
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{chapter3/SI02}
\caption{ Number of sites with abrupt land change per attribute. Number of sites (black line) per attribute of abrupt land change with (\textbf{a}) the relative shift in magnitude, (\textbf{b}) the shift in trend as difference in annual EVI trend, and (\textbf{c}) the time passed between abrupt land change and biodiversity sampling. Background colours in (\textbf{a}) and (\textbf{b}) indicate the binning into six groups for shifts in magnitude (> 50\%, > 25\% to $\leq$ 50\%, and $\leq$ 25\% EVI loss [$---$ to $-$] or gain [$+++$ to $+$]), and in trend (0.01, 0.05, and > 0.05 annual negative [$---$ to $-$] to positive [$+++$ to $+$] EVI trend differences). Gray lines in (\textbf{c}) delineate bins of time passed ($\leq$ 5 years, > 5 and $\leq$ 10 years, and >10 years). Colours as in Figure \ref{F03_02}.}
