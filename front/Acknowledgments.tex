This thesis would not have been completed without the guidance and company of a number of wonderful humans. First of all I would like to thank my main PhD advisor J\"{o}rn for taking me up as a student and for his guidance along the way. Looking back at where I was three and a half years ago I can certainly say that my way of thinking and working has changed, hopefully for the better. I hold in dear memory the dinner evenings at your place and our pub hikes through the South Downs National Park and to this day I still wonder how and when you got past me at the Beachyhead Marathon. Certainly there will be a time and place for a rerun (maybe not over 26.2 miles). I will always be proud to be Scharlemann lab PhD graduate \texttt{\#2}. Thanks J\"{o}rn.

I would also like to thank my second PhD supervisor Pedram for being there for me and having

I hold the words you gave me the start of my PhD dear, that the success of a PhD is not measured by accomplishments, but by learning how to think.
I hope I have succeed learnt to think a bit more.
Looking forward to meet the newest 
And hope greeting to your kids and Lord Rusby

Doing a PhD \textendash\ and especially one that is fully computer-based \textendash\ is often a exhausting experience. I want to thank a number of individuals of the Evolution, behaviour and environment (EBE) section at Sussex for providing the often needed (non)-academic distraction.

Thanks Dan for being always there when I need to talk to someone.

not jealous of fieldwork sites in your postdoc. 

Owen. 
You can do it. Believe in yourself
drinking tours and pub and conference buddy.
Thanks for being a friend.

The same goes for Claudia.

I would also like to thank Richard Hazell and Edwin Pynegar for introducing me

A very special thank you also goes to the guppy lab, specifically Mijke, Jim And Josie. I am certain that I am going miss the regular Friday afternoon office song and all the fun we had at house parties, \textit{runches} and for becoming second at the University of Sussex volleyball tournament. Mine and Owen's office in JMS has certainly been different since you guys left.

Thanks also go to other many other temporary and permanent members of the School of Life Science and EBE in particular, such as Jenny, Craig, Beth G., Will, Paul D., Tanya, Tom and Rasmus and many many more that I cannot possibly list here.
This thesis also would not have been possible without the availability and accessibility of the observational data of millions of species and individuals from (non-)academics across the world through the PREDICTS and BBS databases, for which I am grateful. The same is true for the Earth observation data provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). I continue to be excited about being part of the thriving and innovative global remote sensing community. Zuletzt w\"{u}rde ich gerne meiner Familie danken für all die Jahre an Unterstützung und Rat ohne welchen ich nicht da w\"{a}re wo ich heute bin. Danke Mutsch f\"{u}r dein offenes Ohr und deinen Rat die Welt und bestehendes Wissen zu hinterfragen. Danke Vatsch und JoJo f\"{u}r die netten Stunden daheim. Freue mich schon auf die n\"{a}chsten Besuche in Aachen und kommenden Familientreffen. 
Finally, I would like to end this section by specifically expressing my thanks to the kitchen personnel of the Swan Inn, Falmer for providing me with that steady influx of delicious British cousine throughout my PhD.
